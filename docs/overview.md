# Application Monitoring with Datadog
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to integrate Datadog into the application in order to provide observability, monitoring, alerting, and performance insights. This integration will ensure that developers and operations teams have real-time visibility into system health, user activity, and infrastructure performance.

## 1.2 Scope

The solution will provide:
- Collection of application metrics (CPU, memory, response times, custom business KPIs).
- Centralized logging with structured and contextual data.
- APM (Application Performance Monitoring) for distributed tracing across services.
- Alerting via Datadog monitors integrated into Slack/Email.
- Dashboards for visualizing application performance and health.

Out of scope:
- Long-term log storage (beyond Datadog retention policy).
- Custom third-party alert routing outside of Datadog integrations.

## 2. System Overview

The system will consist of:

- Datadog Agent – installed alongside services to collect metrics and logs.
- Application Instrumentation – SDKs and middleware integrated into the app.
- Datadog APM – traces API calls, background jobs, and database queries.
- Dashboards & Monitors – preconfigured visualizations and alerts.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Metrics
- FR-1: The system shall collect CPU, memory, and network metrics for all containers.
- FR-2: The system shall publish custom application metrics (e.g., request count, error rate, transaction time).
- FR-3: The system shall tag metrics with environment, service, and version.

### 3.2 Logging

- FR-4: The system shall forward application logs to Datadog in JSON format.
- FR-5: The system shall include correlation IDs in logs for traceability.
- FR-6: The system shall redact sensitive data before sending logs.

### 3.3 APM & Tracing

- FR-7: The system shall capture distributed traces across API, database, and background worker services.
- FR-8: The system shall propagate trace IDs in HTTP headers.
- FR-9: The system shall sample traces at a configurable rate.

### 3.4 Alerting

- FR-10: The system shall configure monitors for error rates, high latency, and infrastructure resource usage.
- FR-11: The system shall send alerts via Slack and Email.
- FR-12: The system shall support silencing and maintenance windows for alerts.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-1: Metric ingestion latency must be less than 10 seconds.
- NFR-2: Logs must be searchable in Datadog within 30 seconds of generation.
- NFR-3: The system shall handle at least 10,000 log lines per second without data loss.
- NFR-4: All monitoring must work in staging and production environments.

NFR-5: All configurations must be managed as code (IaC, Terraform preferred).
